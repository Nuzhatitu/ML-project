# ML-project
Enhancing pedestrian detection and tracking in crowded environments using Faster R-CNN reveals patterns through trajectory analysis.
in this reporsitory several ML model for pedestrian Trajectories clustering have been used. 
File description: 
"Agglomerative" is the file where Agglomerative hierarchial clustering has been used.
"K means" - Application of K means Algorithm 
"DTW" - Application of DTW with K means 
"GMM" - Application of Gaussian mixture model
